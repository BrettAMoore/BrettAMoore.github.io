November 15th, 2021 (No Matt)
</p>

<p>
Pisces 22nd, 159 continued
</p>

<p>
The Heirs entered the lair of the Hierophant. The Hierophant was a dessicated animate corpse dressed in red and gold finery, and holding a black and silver scepter. It expressed a desire to conceal itself within their skins so as to escape the extradimensional space and restart its Church of Flesh. The Heirs rallied, and easily defeated the Hierophant. Its life force flowed into its golden throne, which the Heirs then melted, killing the Hierophant for good. They took the scepter and returned up the stairs to the Church of Fate. 
</p>

<p>
In the church, the Heirs found Priscilla forging tablets. She explained her plan to bury them somewhere, then discover them, establishing Hehil as a holy pilgrimmage site. With Scampy dead and the <a href="./Pumpkin_King.html" title="Pumpkin King" class="page">Pumpkin King</a> soon to depart, the scam rights to the Hehil territory were wide open. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs walked to the cornfield where the Pumpkin King dwelled, and gave him the sceptor. It was a sort of puzzle box, which when solved was capable of opening planar gates. In exchange, the King planted Bridgette and Lanaster in the soil, explaining that they would be fully restored in a week. 
</p>

<p>
Kyruss and Damemon returned to Hehil, and enjoyed its luxuries.  Delekhan guarded Lanaster and Bridgette from a tent in the cold cornfield.  
</p>

<p>
Pisces 29th, 159
</p>

<p>
Bridgette and Lanaster returned to life. The Heirs met up in Hehil. Lanaster warned Tibalt about Priscilla's future scams. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs bought two draft horses and a cart, and filled the cart with barrels of food and water. 
</p>

<p>
Pisces 30th, 159
</p>

<p>
The Heirs were ready to depart, but decided to wait for better weather. 
</p>

<p>
Aries 1st, 160
</p>

<p>
New Year's Day in Doncaster. Heavy snowfall and strong winds. The Heirs again waited for better weather. 
</p>

<p>
Aries 2nd, 160
</p>

<p>
The Heirs entered  the Dying Lands. They made good time, and reached the burned down barn. A work crew was building a cottage, a base they'd use while rebuilding the barn. The Heirs learned about waypoint system. 
</p>

<p>
Aries 3rd, 160
</p>

<p>
Strong winds and light snow struck at midday,The team saw tracks, two dozen, made by humanoids, clearly lost. Visibility dropped to thirty feet. They chose to continue on, and found the waypoint barn and its supplies. Delekhan wished to search for the two dozen lost. Kyruss performed a divination, consulting Death for advice, and decided to go. Kyruss, Delekhan, and Lamaster departed the barn. They found the 24, with four already dead. Kyruss called out to them, offering aid. Their leader agreed to accept it, and Kyruss used healing magic to bolster them. Kyruss led the way back to the barn. 
</p>

<p>
Corinne, a young elven woman and the leader of the group, told the tale of the expedition. They were all young people with some fighting experience, who had formed a volunteer company to aid Yisan's army in this time of infiltration by Easterners. They followed the trail of conscript gangs, and wound up in this strange gray place, which certainly was not the Dying Lands, as there was no such thing as the Dying Lands. 
</p>

<p>
Lanaster played "There's No Such Thing As The Dying Lands", and worked with Delekhan to drop truth bombs on Corinne and her group, convincing them of Yisan's lies and Sarkhan Vol's evil. The Twenty pledged themselves to the Heirs, but were advised to just return home. 
</p>

<p>
Aries 4th, 160
</p>

<p>
The Twenty were given a pound of food each and thanked the Heirs again. Their plan to depart to the west was delayed by strong winds. The Heirs departed anyway, braving the winds. They reached a river, with a chain crossing it from boulder to boulder. Lanaster made the treacherous crossing, and brought the ferry across to pick up the horses and his teammates. This barn had a farmhouse next to it. 
</p>

<p>
Lanaster knocked on the farmhouse door, and met an elderly farmer, who was shocked than anyone had even attempted a crossing in this kind of weather. He asked Lanaster a challenge question - "What is carved on Yisan's tree?" Lanaster didn't answer, instead feigning outrage that he'd be bothered with such things on a night like this. Lanaster returned to barn, and moved heavy water barrels in front of barn doors.
