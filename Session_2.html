May 17th, 2021
</p>

<p>
In the steaming jungle of the <a href="./Blue_Swamp.html" title="Blue Swamp" class="page">Blue Swamp</a>, <a href="./Kruxx,_Chief_of_Peace.html" title="Kruxx, Chief of Peace" class="page">Kruxx, Chief of Peace</a>, announced the invitation from <a href="./King_Harold_III.html" title="King Harold III" class="page">King Harold III</a> to come to his court at Maltby. A ceremonial feast was proclaimed for the occasion. The traditional game for a diplomatic feast was a velociraptor. A hunting party was assembled, including Kyruss and led by Kruxx. The party was blessed, and departed the village for the hunt. Eight days were spent, in the vain pursuit of velociraptors. They were common game, and the inability to find one was a dire omen. 
</p>

<p>
Kruxx called off the hunt, and the party returned, dejected. Conversation around the village held that the failed hunt was due to <a href="./Kyruss_Heresy.html" title="Kyruss's heresy" class="page">Kyruss's heresy</a>, angering the animistic gods of the swamp. Kruxx took his son aside and stressed the need for diplomacy and the alliance with the humans, especially in the face of such an ill omen. The pair swam down the Aire River to Maltby. 
</p>

<p>
In Maltby, the other Heirs resolved to find George Brockway, who may or may not be undead. As they departed the King's Drip, they spotted Kyruss on the street. A reunion was held, and the full group of Heirs split into two teams, to search for Brockway. 
</p>

<p>
Both teams found bodies, slumped against the wall as though drunk, but actually killed by some supernatural force. By chance, both teams converged on the same street, where another body lay against a well. Kyruss examined it, concluding that it had been killed by an undead creature, and would, in time, transform into one itself. He cast <i>gentle repose</i> to prevent this.
</p>

<p>
The Heirs began searching the street, starting with the Hammer and Nail Tavern, and moving on to a shrine to Winfrid Sunward, a legendary figure and co-founder of Doncaster. The shrine contained a heroic statue of Sunward, with a determined expression, dark skin, and white hair. Above it was chiseled a saying, "This Land I Will Defend". To either side were altars, upon which parishioners placed offerings. 
</p>

<p>
Five townsfolk were slumped against an altar, unconscious but alive. Looming over them was a shadowy figure of supernatural evil, that was once George Brockway. It hissed that it needed their joy to fill the void within it, and the Heirs gave battle. Kogrash placed it in a grapple, while the others hurled spells and projectiles, overcoming the creature, which was placed in restraints and carried to the royal manor. 
</p>

<p>
On the way there, a town crier read a royal proclamation, that all was well, and that the King had been in contact with Myles Mornshield, the Lightbringer of Doncaster, who agreed that there was no danger.
</p>

<p>
Outside the manor, <a href="./Captain_Trilby.html" title="Captain Trilby" class="page">Captain Trilby</a> and about half the Maltby regiment of King's Guard were stationed around the perimeter. With the King's permission, the Heirs and their captive monster were allowed inside, where the King and Kirri were having dinner. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs confronted the King with the evidence, and Lannister upbraided him for using his father's name falsely. Kirri chimed in, supporting the Heirs. Harold revealed that Zugash had disobeyed his orders and returned to Holwick the day before, and agreed to revisit the matter the next day. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs decided that they must travel west and put an end to the danger. 
</p>

<p>
Lannister went home to find some gear. Elfrid saw him, and the two chatted. When Lannister revealed his intentions, Elfrid told him that he was in no way ready to go to the West, and would die there. Instead, he encouraged Lannister to hide until the trouble was over, then write songs about it. Lannister told him that the quest was something he had to do, and assembled a set of gear from the family armory. When his mother learned of his plans, she cried, told him he'd be great, and to be himself, not try and be Myles. 
</p>

<p>
The next morning, militia patrolled the streets of Maltby, supplementing the King's Guard. 
</p>

<p>
Delekhan went to shop for gear, and was confronted by his father, who'd come all the way from Elvandar to drag him back home. Delekhan told him what was happening, but Aedin was unmoved, and ordered him to come home. When Delekhan refused, Aedin proclaimed that he had no son, and departed. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs, and Kirri, traveled to Holwick. There, Zugash was supervising a militia callup. Kruxx was there as well, visiting Zugash. Kruxx and Kyruss took a walk, with Kruxx expressing support for the journey into the West, as it would redeem Kyruss the heretic in the eyes of the tribe. 
</p>

<p>
Kirri and Damemon took a walk. Kirri was afraid that Damemon would have to do terrible things to survive out there, which would condemn him to hell. She encouraged him to die before that happened, if an opportunity presented itself. 
</p>

<p>
Zugash and Kogrash took a walk. Zugash believed his son was ready for the challenge, but cautioned him that he might day out there, though there was no shame in doing so. Should he return alive and with his honor, he'd have proven himself worthy of being the next Aegis. 
</p>

<p>
Bridgette had no one. She climbed a tree and watched the others.
