</p>

<p>
Capricornus 12th, 159
</p>

<p>
The Heirs, rejoined by Bridgett, Nu'wor, and Wrstr crouched at the edge of the M'hok village. They devised a plan, and sent their Bagiennik allies to join with the remaining new low-caste member of the tribe. The three bodly crossed the rocky barrier that excluded the low caste from the village proper, drawing an immediate response from the new high-caste members. The new low-caste members called upon the middle caste for aid, and bellowed that they had outsiders of their own on their side. The new high-caste members called upon <a href="./Kardur.html" title="Kardur" class="page">Kardur</a>.
</p>

<p>
Kardur was immense, with fingers like bananas, an iron helmet from which a green light shone. His hulking physique was covered in glowing green arcane runes. He proclaimed himself to be a slave of <a href="./Hazduhr,_Abbot_of_Agony.html" title="Hazduhr, Abbot of Agony" class="page">Hazduhr, Abbot of Agony</a>, the Left Hand of Sarkhan Vol, and charged into battle against Kogrash, joined by a Bagiennik. 
</p>

<p>
A ferocious battle ensued. Kardur refused to surrender, saying that he must honor his vow of service to Hazduhr. Though Kogrash was battered quite badly, the Heirs prevailed, killing Kardur. The new high-caste Bagienniks surrendered. 
</p>

<p>
Restored as chief, Nu'wor proclaimed even harsher conditions for the low caste to live under. Lanaster spoke to the tribe, eloquently urging them to end the caste system. Realizing that being divided against themselves made them vulnerable to Kardur and his gang, Nu'wor agreed, and the rocky barrier was removed. All M'hok could now visit the shrine. 
</p>

<p>
The Bagienniks settled in for an evening of ceremonial singing to commemorate this momentous day. Those who had stood with Kardur knew only that he came from some hills to the north, across a river. The Heirs stayed the night in the village. Damemon was tormented by nightmares, though he kept this to himself. 
</p>

<p>
Capricornus 13th, 159
</p>

<p>
The Heirs resolved to fight this place in the hills to the north, across the river. With Bridgette's expert guidance, they traversed the Black Swamp twice as fast as before, and found a bounty of food and water. Damemon's nightmares continued. 
</p>

<p>
Capricornus 14th, 159
</p>

<p>
The Heirs continued their travels north through the swamp. Damemon's nightmares continued. 
</p>

<p>
Capricornus 15th, 159
</p>

<p>
The Heirs found a river in the swamp. Based on Kogrash's cartographical knowledge, they decided to follow the river west. Damemon's nightmares continued. 
</p>

<p>
Capricornus 16th, 159
</p>

<p>
The Heirs reached a transition zone, where the swamp was thinning out.  Damemon's nightmares continued. 
</p>

<p>
Capricornus 17th, 159
</p>

<p>
The Heirs reached a shrine, where the swamp transitioned to a dense forest. It was built on stone pilings, into which iron was hammered. The twisted mass of iron was topped with two iron horns. Gazing upon the abstract work induced a feeling of subservience. Kogrash resolved to destroy the shrine, which Delekhan believed was to <a href="./Sarkhan_Vol.html" title="Sarkhan Vol" class="page">Sarkhan Vol</a>. Damemon used a spell to attack the shrine's stone foundation. The horns atop it turned to face Damemon, and a green mist poured from Damemon's eyes into the swampy ground, from which emerged four putrid bodies, animated by a malevolent green glow. They asked Damemon to join them, to come to their side, and began pummeling Damemon and Lanaster.
</p>

<p>
The Heirs gave the things battle, enduring the terrible necrotic leethes the things spat out. Damemon was brought down, but saved by Kyruss. Eventually, all four putrid haunts were destroyed. Filled with renewed purpose, the Heirs methodically leveled and scattered the shrine. 
</p>

<p>
Damemon's nightmares ended. 
</p>

<p>
Capricornus 18th-19th, 159
</p>

<p>
The Heirs traversed the forest. 
</p>

<p>
Capricornus 20th, 159
</p>

<p>
The Heirs, still following the river west, emerged from the forest onto rolling grasslands. They spotted <a href="./Simonon.html" title="a town" class="page">a town</a>, and walked to it. The town was surrounded by a rectangular wooden pallisade fence, with open gates on the short ends. The Heirs entered, finding a small-scale town, which was very neat and well-ordered. They heard voices from deeper in the town, and found a crowd of hundreds of halflings being addressed by a human woman, standing in a garden. She wore plate armor, had olive skin and shiny black hair, and wore a holy symbol of horns. By her side was a zombie ogre.
</p>

<p>
The woman was scolding the townsfolk about building a community garden, in defiance of the will of Hazduhr, Abbot of Agony. For this sinful wickedness, their garden and crops would be destroyed.
