June 28th, 2021 (No Tristan)
</p>

<p>
Capricornus 25th, 159 continued
</p>

<p>
The Heirs were attacked by Zandar, who could abide no rivals to his ambitions. Zandar's wounds revealed him to be undead. The Heirs fought as a team, and defeated him.
</p>

<p>
The Heirs advanced through a heavy curtain, where they saw a giant shrine to <a href="./Sarkhan_Vol.html" title="Sarkhan Vol" class="page">Sarkhan Vol</a>, an exquisite golden altar, and two ogres, one of whom had a great blue horn protruding from his forehead. The ogres were greatly offended by the intrusion into their holy place, and gave the Heirs battle. The horned ogre, Atorak, praised Sakrhan Vol for bringing strength through order. During the battle, the ogres focused on Kyruss, and after one of their blows, a strange supernatural effect erupted, exhausting Kyruss. Another strong blow affected Kogrash, spoiling his food and water. 
</p>

<p>
The two ogres were killed, and the Heirs ventured upstairs. 
</p>

<p>
Kyruss took a staircase into a sizeable, if pedestrian, library. On the other side of the second floor was a bar and lounge, where an undead man named Pendergrast tended bar. He served drinks to Lanaster and Kogrash, but Kogrash realized that the drinks had been poisoned. He poured one on Pendergrast's shoes, and stabbed him, expecting a mere zombie. Pendergrast proved to be far stronger than a mere zombie, as well as being full of poison, and gave the Heirs everything they could handle, though eventually Bridgette's arrows and Kyruss's spells took their toll. After the battle, Lanaster realized that his food and water had also spoiled. 
</p>

<p>
The team found a well-stocked larder of fine food and drink, and took a rest. When they emerged, they explored further, finding several offices. Within, bureaucratic functionaries tabulated food production caps and enforcement reports, making Hazduhr's regime of food control possible. Repulsed, the Heirs massacred them all. 
</p>

<p>
Pressing on, the Heirs located <a href="./Hazduhr,_Abbot_of_Agony.html" title="Hazduhr, Abbot of Agony" class="page">Hazduhr, Abbot of Agony</a>. He was a plump man in his fifties, with a left hand that was inky black. He questioned the Heirs, and upon learning who Kogrash was, spoke at length to the Heirs. 
</p>

<p>
Hazduhr informed them that he too was from <a href="./Kingdom_of_Doncaster.html" title="Doncaster" class="page">Doncaster</a>, he'd been a cleric of the harvest god <a href="./Karavol.html" title="Karavol" class="page">Karavol</a>, devoted to charity and improving agriculture. When Sarkvan Vol's forces conquered Doncaster, they diverted farm output to themselves. This enraged Hazduhr, and he joined the heroes heading west - Jeff Cooper, Kirri Starnon, Kruxx, Aedin Tarathiel, Myles Mornshield, Zugash Broadbrow...and another, a woman named Garna. 
</p>

<p>
While traversing the West, the eight heroes from Doncaster picked up six more allies. The fourteen made their way to Sarkhan Vol's citadel and battled him. Three of them died in the attempt. A pact was made - six of the survivors would return home, and the other five would remain in the West and guard against Sarkhan Vol's return. In ten years, the six would return and relieve the five. Ten years passed, and <a href="./the_Six_Great_Heroes.html" title="the Six Great Heroes" class="page">the Six Great Heroes</a> never returned. 
</p>

<p>
As the years passed, Hazduhr's beliefs changed. He came to believe that fertile farms and bountiful harvests led to idleness, gluttony, and sin. All the while, Sarkhan Vol was growing within the five. Five years ago, Sarkhan Vol was able to recreate his physical form, and retook his throne. The five came to serve him as the <a href="./Lords_of_Ruin.html" title="Lords of Ruin" class="page">Lords of Ruin</a>. Each was gifted a part of Sarkhan Vol, which enhanced their own power, and meant that so long as one of the Lords lived, Sarkhan Vol could not be destroyed again. 
</p>

<p>
His story told, Hazduhr asked the Heirs to join his cause. He'd one been young and idealistic like them, and now he could see how wrong he'd been as a young man. The Heirs refused, and after a vicious combat, killed Hazduhr. The Left Hand of Sarkhan Vol dissolved away into smoke, leaving just a black outline, like one of the <a href="./Deformed_Birds.html" title="deformed birds" class="page">deformed birds</a>.
