June 21st, 2021 (No Rob)
</p>

<p>
Capricornus 20th, 159 continued 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs confronted <a href="./Okierie_Onadowan.html" title="Okierie Onadowan" class="page">Okierie Onadowan</a> in the community garden of the town of <a href="./Simonon.html" title="Simonon" class="page">Simonon</a>, and fought her and her ogre zombie Brutus to a standstill. While the others gave battle, Delekhan used his illusion spells to imitate Okierie in order to issue false orders to Brutus. 
</p>

<p>
Okierie was captured, and the halfling townsfolk brought out ale and musical instruments, sang ballods, and made merry. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs met two of the town elders, Hari and Bowbi. They related the history of <a href="./Simonon.html" title="Simonon" class="page">Simonon</a> - generations of peace and plenty, followed by subjugation under <a href="./Sarkhan_Vol.html" title="Sarkhan Vol" class="page">Sarkhan Vol</a>, with their strongest sons taken as slave soldiers, and their farms used to grow food for Sarkhan Vol's legions. After Sarkhan Vol's defeat, Simonon enjoyed twenty more years of peace and plenty, after which <a href="./Hazduhr,_Abbot_of_Agony.html" title="Hazduhr" class="page">Hazduhr</a> arrived. He established strict caps on how much food each farm could produce, and sent his agent Okierie to monitor and adjust the quotas. 
</p>

<p>
As the permissable food production was barely subsistence level, the town elders decided to start the community garden. As it was owned by no one, they hoped it would be a sort of loophole in Hazduhr's rules. 
</p>

<p>
The elders also shared their knowledge of the surrounding grasslands with the Heirs. 
</p>

<p>
Capricornus 21st, 159
</p>

<p>
Simonon was battered by strong winds and light rain. Okierie was interrogated. She told her story, that Hazduhr arrived in her village with his forces, and she swore allegience to him and trained in his religious doctrine. Hazduhr's abbey was located in the hills to the West, and Okierie was willing to reveal the precise location in exchange for her release. 
</p>

<p>
Okierie also explained Hazduhr's theology: people who were well-fed and comfortable were capable of sin, whereas those who were in desperate want were in an animalistic state, and thus incapable of sin. Therefore, the people must be kept in that state of hunger and exhausting labor. She held the Heirs in disdain for their decadence, profanity, and violence, punctuated when Kogrash broke her wrist in a failed bid to extract information and Bridgette slapped her across the face. 
</p>

<p>
Okierie herself was fit and well-fed, she claimed to have the religious training necessary to resist sin (including profanity), and needed good food to sustain her on her travels. 
</p>

<p>
Okierie learned Damemon's mother's name, and claimed that Hazduhr knew her. She asked Damemon to free her and go to Hazduhr to learn more, but he declined. 
</p>

<p>
Kogrash insisted on subjecting Okierie to the justice of Simonon, over the objections of Delekhan, who wished to use her to find Hazduhr's abbey. Kogrash's view prevailed, and the seven elders of Simonon placed Okierie on trial for her five years of tormenting and starving their people. Her defense was that her actions were necessary for the spiritual salvation of the town. She was found guilty, confined to a halfling-sized metal cage, and drowned in the river. The mood in the town grew somber, as they took no joy in having to take a life.  
</p>

<p>
Capricornus 22nd, 159
</p>

<p>
The Heirs traveled west, following the river. They reached the hills in the early afternoon. The river cut through the hills in a steepening ravine. 
</p>

<p>
Capricornus 23rd, 159
</p>

<p>
The day was freezing cold, down to 20 degrees F. Bridgette had acquired cold weather gear in Simonon, the others had not. Lanaster and Kogrash were particularly affected by the cold. 
</p>

<p>
Capricornus 24th, 159
</p>

<p>
The day was hot and muggy,  as the Heirs climbed higher in the hills. 
</p>

<p>
Capricornus 25th, 159
</p>

<p>
Another miserable day found the Heirs, temperatures rising above 100 degrees, and strong winds buffeted the hills. In the afternoon, they came upon an abbey, built overlooking the ravine. It was large, and magnificently appointed with marble and gold. A series of staircases led down to a pier on the river, with several boats. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs decided to boldly approach the abbey, and Damemon knocked on the door. It was opened by a tall humanoid male with skin the color of stone and red eyes. He wore exotic silk pants in a strange style, and a turban. He gave his name as Zandar, the vizier of Hazduhr. 
</p>

<p>
Zandar allowed the Heirs into the entry hall, which was decorated with six large paintings:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Plump bald human man, about 50, in fine vestments, black left hand - Hazduhr, Abbot of Agony</li>
<li>The same plump bald man, denying food to a grateful mass of peasants. </li>
<li>Severe looking pale elven woman, about 60, with dark hair in a bun, sunken eyes, left eye is black, uncomfortable high-collared dress - Mileena, the Mindrazer</li>
<li>Muscular human woman, mid 40s, dark skin and white hair, armor, black right hand - Garna, Forge of Wrath</li>
<li>Paper-white, red eyed man, about 40, in luxurious fabrics with tights and a ruff, hoisting a golden goblet, black teeth - Vizkopa, the Blood Baron</li>
<li>Slender tiefling man in simple attire, mid 40s, playing a cittern, singing, black mouth, soulful look - Yisan, Father of Lies </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Zandar identified the five as the <a href="./Lords_of_Ruin.html" title="Lords of Ruin" class="page">Lords of Ruin</a>. He questioned the Heirs about who they were, and shared that he was "a traveller from an antique land", drawn to this place when he sensed Sarkhan Vol's power. He joined Hazduhr's court in order to rise in the ranks and grow his own power. 
</p>

<p>
Lanaster replied that it was the same situation for him, but Zandar cried that he couldn't abide a rival, and attacked!
