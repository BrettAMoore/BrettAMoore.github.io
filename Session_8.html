<p>
Aquarius 1st, 159 continued
</p>

<p>
A curious crowd gathered outside the haberdasher, people of Fleming who asked whether it was true that Hazduhr was dead. The Heirs confirmed this, and the crowd cheered. They mentioned that Galandrion, an agent of Hazduhr, was in town, weighing the fish catch. The Heirs investigated, finding a snooty half-elf at a booth. He refused to believe that Hazduhr was dead, and was thrown into the freezing cold Tamar River. Delekhan took pity and tossed him a rope and Galandrion walked away toward the abbey. 
</p>

<p>
The people of Fleming told the Heirs that they were forbidden to cross the river, or to even own boats. They shared the tale of Mort Bellamy, who maintained a secret cow pasture and shared with his neighbors. Mort had a saying, “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.” When he was discovered, he escaped across the river with his family on a coracle boat he’d built for just such an occasion. The forces of Hazduhr were unwilling to chase him across the river. 
</p>

<p>
The townsfolk resolved to help the Heirs build a boat. 
</p>

<p>
Aquarius 2nd, 159
</p>

<p>
Boat-building. 
</p>

<p>
Aquarius 3rd, 159
</p>

<p>
Boat completed. The new holiday of Boat Day was declared. The Heirs crossed the Tamar River, establishing a ferry. They found desolate grasslands on the other side, and began walking west. 
</p>

<p>
Aquarius 4th, 159
</p>

<p>
Light winds. Temperatures in the 40s. Traveled west. 
</p>

<p>
Aquarius 5th, 159
</p>

<p>
Light snowfall, unseasonably cold (20s), strong wind. 
</p>

<p>
Aquarius 6th, 159
</p>

<p>
Light snowfall, strong wind. The Heirs reached a forest. 
</p>

<p>
Aquarius 7th, 159
</p>

<p>
Traveled west through the forest
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Blizzard!
</p>

<p>
The Heirs entered the forest and made a secure camp. Against all reason, Kogrash went out to hunt, failed, and became lost. Realizing he was overdue, Lanaster and Delekhan went out in search of him, taking a tent. After an hour, they found him, wandering and delirous, and led him back to camp. 
</p>

<p>
Aquarius 14th, 159

</p>

<p>
Aquarius 22nd, 159
</p>

<p>
Nice weather. Found felled trees and drag marks leading west. 
</p>

<p>
Aquarius 23rd, 159
</p>

<p>
Nice weather. The Heirs followed the drag marks west. 296 miles from where they crossed the Tamar River, they came across <a href="./Camden.html" title="Camden" class="page">Camden</a>, a small hamlet of seven buildings. They stopped at the first cottage and met a man, Oliver, who was fearful that the Heirs would break "the rules". He was flabbergasted that the heirs didn't know what the rules were, and when they began asking questions, he informed them that they'd broken the rules. He did tell them that the hamlet had a burgomaster named Karl, and the Heirs went into the streets, with Kogrash hollering for Karl. A tall man emerged from the nicest cottage and informed them that he was Karl. 
</p>

<p>
Karl invited them in, and introduced his family: wife Mary, and children Elizabeth (15), Edwin (13), Erica (10), Elias (7) and Eamann (5). Karl was also afraid that the rules had been broken, and that a man-who-wasn't-a-man would come and take them away, but since they'd already been broken, he decided to talk. 
</p>

<p>
Karl revealed that he and everyone else knew the rules, but didn't know how they'd learned them, and also the consequences for breaking them. Among the rules detailed were: no travel unless you could return home before nightfall; no religion of any kind; and no schools.
</p>

<p>
Their host also shared that he could only remember Eamann being born, not his other children, and couldn't remember growing up in Camden, though he felt like he'd always lived there. He was frustrated by how much he didn't know. 
</p>

<p>
A heavy knock came at the door. Karl and Mary huddled together, as did the children. Their home had been surrounded by a mechanical huntsman and his four mechanical hounds. The huntsman declared that the rules had been broken, and he would be taking them away. A defiant Kogrash used the <i>ring of the ram</i>, which caught the huntsman's attention, he demanded the item as well. The hounds were well-disciplined, staying on guard in their sector until someone left the cottage or attacked them. 
</p>

<p>
A prolonged, savage battle broke out, ranging throughout, around, and on top of the cottage. Bridgette was nearly killed, and the huntsman and the hounds exploded when destroyed, a nasty surprise for the Heirs. After fighting one another to a standstill, the Heirs prevailed over their clockwork foes.
