August 2nd, 2021 (No Brady or Tyler)
</p>

<p>
The Heirs secured the fourth floor of Mileena's tower. They heard three beings talking on the floor above, committing to a stalwart defense. 
</p>

<p>
A ruckus was heard outside, and Lanaster and Damemon went outside to investigate. 
</p>

<p>
Kyruss shared his belief that the magical circles doubled spells, and they used two of them for healing. Steeling themselves, they charged up the stairs, finding a laboratory and workshop, where human and demihuman souls were extracted and bound within constructs. A man was strapped to a table, and the party was attacked by a mud golem and a glass golem. During the battle, Kyruss stepped on a ragged looking rug, which turned out to be a death shroud golem. 
</p>

<p>
The battle was well-contested, but the Heirs vanquished all three golems. The man was rescued; his name was Gustav, his son had fallen gravely ill, and he traveled overland to find aid. He didn't make it far before being captured by a huntsman. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs charged up to the sixth and final floor, where they were blocked by a row of clockwork servants. Behind them was Mileena, the Mindrazer, a middle-aged elven woman in a black and white dress, with a black and red cape. 
</p>

<p>
Mileena spoke to the Heirs at length. She was a believer in literacy and education, and declared war on Sarkhan Vol when his legions conquered her lands and closed her schools. She joined the Fourteen Great Heroes and destroyed Sarkhan Vol. She vowed to remain in the West, and Aiden Tarathiel stayed with her. The two conceived a child, Delekhan, who Aiden ran away with. Mileena stayed in the West, honoring her vow. Over time, she came to believe that knowledge was only as powerful as it was rare. She burned books as she read them, and converted the students at her wizard academy into clockwork servants. 
</p>

<p>
When Sarkhan Vol returned, he granted Mileena his left eye. This allowed her to know and modify the thoughts of her subjects. She wiped their knowledge and imposed the rules. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs pledged to end Mileena's tyranny. She seized control of Kogrash's mind with a <i>dominate person </i>spell, ordering him to kill her son. Bridgette's arrows managed to break her concentration and end the spell. The Heirs were able to break the line of servants and get Mileena in a pincer, and she used her <i>cape of the mountbank </i>to dimension door down to the fouth floor. Delekhan sprinted down to the third floor, and the other three reached the fourth, right in time to be caught in a doubled <i>fireball </i>from Mileena. 
</p>

<p>
Kyruss managed to regain consciousness and heal Bridgette and Kogrash, while Delekhan ran upstairs and landed a telling blow. Against all odds, the Heirs rallied and killed Mileena. Delekhan took her wand, an arcane focus, and carried her body higher up on the mountains to expose it. 
</p>

<p>
The other Heirs celebrated, and saw that Elihu, the half-orc blacksmith from Torbay, had battled a huntsman alongside Lanaster and Damemon. Elihu said that he wanted to explore and find more of his kind, by which he meant both half-orcs and blacksmiths. The Heirs agreed to let him travel with them. 
</p>

<p>
The top floor of the tower yielded a magical map of Mileena's domain, which showed the position of each huntsman. None of the huntsmen were moving. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs rested for the night in the tower. 
</p>

<p>
Aquarius 30th
</p>

<p>
Bridgette burned the tower down. <br>
Traveled south. Gustav headed northeast back toward Teighbridge, where he was from. 
</p>

<p>
Pisces 1st, 159
</p>

<p>
Reached Torbay, spread the word of Mileena's death. 
</p>

<p>
Pisces 2nd, 159
</p>

<p>
Cold. Watchtower, found inert hunstman and four hounds, destroyed them. 
</p>

<p>
Pisces 3rd, 159
</p>

<p>
Light snow. Swung south.
</p>

<p>
Pisces 4th, 159
</p>

<p>
Traveled south. 
</p>

<p>
Pisces 5th, 159
</p>

<p>
Traveled south, reached Torridge. Saw great lake, and boats. Elihu was blown away. Negotiated with a ship captain named Amos Bartleby. Traded knowledge of their gold stash for passage on his ship. 
</p>

<p>
Note: Kyruss uses Guardian of Faith
