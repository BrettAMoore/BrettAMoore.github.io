May 10th, 2021
</p>

<p>
In Holwick, Zogash Broadbrow informed Kogrash Broadbrow that they'd both been summoned to the court of King Harold III in Maltby. They called up miitia units to cover their absence. 
</p>

<p>
In Elvandar, Aedin Tarathiel barged in on Delekhan, and ordered him to obey the summons to the King's Court, then hurry back and attend to his studies. He was instructed to be on his best high elven behavior for the duration. 
</p>

<p>
In Liverpool, Bridgette Cooper was in town for some trading, when she was approached by three reverent members of the King's Guard, who escorted her to Maltby and the King's Court. 
</p>

<p>
In Maltby, Kirri Starnon, Hell's Mistress knocked on Damemon's room door, and told him of the summons. She asked Damemon to behave himself, as they owed the King a great debt for granted them such wealth, and that if Damemon was a bad person, he'd be condemned to Hell like she was after her infernal bargain with Hadeldrachen.
</p>

<p>
Also in Maltby, Mira Mornshield fetched Lannister Mornshield from the King's Drip tavern, where Lannister had just finished a performance. That night his opening act was an up and coming singer-songwriter named George Brockway.  Mira informed the petulant Lannister of the summons. 
</p>

<p>
At the King's Court, King Harold III greeted the Heirs, and explained that there was to a pageant commemorating the 25th anniversary of the end of the Dark Times, and he would like each of the Heirs to portray their parent onstage. He turned them over to Rigby, one of his court entertainers and the director of the pageant. 
</p>

<p>
The Heir spent two days with Rigby, rehearsing the pageant and reconnecting with one another. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, on the 22nd of Sagittarius, the Harvest Festival ceremony began on a large stage erected in the town square. King Harold III gave speech about the great recovery of Doncaster from the Dark Times, and the strength of its people. Statues of the Six Great Heroes, made of stone and ten feet tall, were unveiled.
</p>

<p>
The pageant followed, with competent performances from the Heirs. The king watched from a throne. Six grand chairs had been set out for the Six Great Heroes. Kirri and Zugash attended; Aedin stayed in Elvandar, Kruxx stayed in the Blue Swamp, John Cooper was dead, and Myles Mornshield was missing. 
</p>

<p>
After the pageant, Rigby delivered bouqets, then invited the cast to the King's Drip for an after party, and the Heirs agreed to attend. Delekhan told the others he'd never felt more alive than onstage just then. Bridgette climbed her father's statue to place flowers upon it. 
</p>

<p>
On their way to the tavern, a deformed bird landed on the cobbslestone street in front of the Heirs. Kogrash Broadbrow launched into action, striking the bird with his weapon. The animal dissolved away, leaving only its outline on the stone. 
</p>

<p>
Alarmed, the Heirs traveled to the nearest King's Guard outpost and reported their sighting. The guard on duty took them to a captain, who took them to the King, who was dining with Kirri and Zugash. Kogrash reported the deformed bird. King Harold was dismissive, assuming that the bird was a remnant of decades before, and feared a panic if word got out. Kirri emphasized that Sarkhan Vol was destroyed. Zugash was also concerned about panic, but suggested a discrete investigation by the King's Guard, which Harold agreed to. 
</p>

<p>
The next day, the Heirs rode out from Maltby in different directions. Lannister Mornshield noticed a boarded up farmhouse, where a family had taken refuge from a deformed bird sitting in their tree. Lannister evacuated the family to Maltby. 
</p>

<p>
Damemon passed through Hope's Landing, where he saw townsfolk digging a pit. He investigated, and learned that 100 cattle across three farms had twisted and mutated overnight, and the farmers were planning to slaugher, burn, and bury them in the pit. Damemon assisted them, and collected a sample of green ichor. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs met up in the King's Drip in Maltby and compared their findings. The barkeep poured them a fresh round, and told Lannister that George Brockway had died the day before, run down by a horse in the street. A man at the bar reacted with shock at this news, saying that he'd seen Brockway only an hour before on the street.
