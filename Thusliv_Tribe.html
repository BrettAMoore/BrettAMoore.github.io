The Thusliv Tribe are a band of lizardmen who dwell in the <a href="./Blue_Swamp.html" title="Blue Swamp" class="page">Blue Swamp</a>, north of the <a href="./Kingdom_of_Doncaster.html" title="Kingdom of Doncaster" class="page">Kingdom of Doncaster</a>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>History</b>
</p>

<p>
The tribe has lived in the Blue Swamp for centuries. Fearsome and territorial creatures, they were left alone by the Kingdom, for to tread in the swamp uninvited was to court death. 
</p>

<p>
In the year 130, they were invaded, conquered, and oppressed by <a href="./the_Invaders.html" title="the invaders" class="page">the invaders</a> from the west, in their own version of the <a href="./the_Dark_Times.html" title="Dark Times" class="page">Dark Times</a>. Their mightiest warrior, <a href="./Kruxx,_Chief_of_Peace.html" title="Kruxx, Chief of Peace" class="page">Kruxx, Chief of Peace</a>, joined the Six Great Heroes, traveled to the west, and in the year 134, defeated Sarkhan Vol. This plunged the invaders into disarray, allowing the lizardmen to cast off their shackles and kill their tormentors. 
</p>

<p>
Since the end of the Dark Times, relations with the Kingdom have grown closer, each recognizing the need for mutual defense against common enemies. There are regular diplomatic visits between the tribe and the Kingdom, and the great hero Kruxx is as revered in Doncaster as he is in the Blue Swamp. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Culture</b>
</p>

<p>
The lizardmen have a coming of age ceremony where you have to hunt and kill something in the swamp.  You then use its entire body, making decorative items with its bones, its skin for whatever use they have, the meat to feed the tribe during your ceremony.  The better the kill the more respected the new adult is.
</p>

<p>
They have a strong if alien aesthetic sense.  They have little need for clothing, but they like to adorn their bodies with ornaments that won't break down quickly in the cool, moist swamplands.  Of particular popularity are metals that don't corrode/stop corroding like gold and brass, and animal bones.  A young, unimpressive lizardfolk might have a variety of animal bones scrimshawed decoratively as necklaces or attached to belts, while a strong and wealthy lizardfolk like my character has a wide assortment of unusual carved bones and gold and other metal bracelets, anklets, etc.  While a good bit of the material has value the heavy, chunky, clashing designs tend to offend most human aesthetic sensibilities.  
</p>

<p>
Food is of utmost importance to all social occasions of the tribe.  Before any celebration hunters gather game, and the cooks prepare the meal for everyone to share.  Many holidays and events call for particular kinds of food to be gathered, and failure to do so is considered a very bad omen.  One of the primary trade goods that the lizardfolk have offered the rest of the region has been unusual furs/skins and meats, along with herbs and medicinal and magical components.  All of these trade deals are of course agreed to at a feast.
</p>

<p>
This tradition continues with funerals, as the tribal tradition is that the body contains the soul, and if left there it risks rising as the undead.  Burial isn't feasible in the swamp, and the dead are meat, so the traditional funeral is cook and eat the dead lizardfolk, sharing the meat with the entire tribe, and using the bones to make a memorial sculpture, with small bones being turned into decorative jewelry for those that want to remember the dead.  This practice makes the humans deeply uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
<b>Religion</b>
</p>

<p>
The tribe doesn't worship gods, but rather primal forces of existing.  Life, Death, the Seasons, the Hunt, etc.  These aren't <i>quite</i> personified in the sense of a pantheon, but they are held to have a will and existence of their own, and ceremonies to each of the forces are held yearly in the form of, you guessed it, ceremonial feasts.
</p>

<p>
In recent years, the conventional religion has been challenged by the <a href="./Kyruss_Heresy.html" title="Kyruss Heresy" class="page">Kyruss Heresy</a>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Government</b>
</p>

<p>
The tribal government is somewhat complicated.  The oldest member of the tribe born in each calendar month is part of the Council of Elders, who's job is elect the villages Three Chiefs.
</p>

<p>
These Chiefs are the leaders of the village, and they each have control over different parts of the community.
</p>

<p>
The Shaman Chief is in charge of all religious practices.
</p>

<p>
The Peace Chief is in charge of the community in peacetime and runs the normal activities of governance. <a href="./Kruxx,_Chief_of_Peace.html" title="Kruxx, Chief of Peace" class="page">Kruxx, Chief of Peace</a> is the current Peace Chief. 
</p>

<p>
The War Chief is responsible for military matters and can overrule the other chiefs during wartime as necessary.
</p>

<p>
A chief appointment must be reaffirmed yearly, although most who do well serve for decades.  At any time a unanimous decision by the Elder Council can replace a chief before the yearly affirmation.
</p>

<p>
In addition each profession within the tribe (cooks, smiths, warriors, shamans, etc.) gathers once a year and splits evenly into groups of approximately ten individuals.  These groups then select one member to represent them in a group called the Body.  The Body meets on each New Moon to discuss the laws of the Tribe and pass new ones as needed.
