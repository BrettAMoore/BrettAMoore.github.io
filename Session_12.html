August 9th, 2021 (No Tristan)
</p>

<p>
Pisces 6th, 159
</p>

<p>
Kyruss preached in the town square of Torridge. Kogrash taught new smithing methods to the people. Lanaster told tales of the Heirs' adventures. The people went nuts for it and followed him to the docks, chanting for the Heirs to stay in Torridge. On the waterfront, the Heirs saw that the <i>Constance </i>was being renamed <i>Spellbinding Susan</i>. Captain Amos Bartleby explained that his memory was returning, including memories of a beloved wife named Susan. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs set sail, heading eastward. They stopped in in the small port town of Exeter, and spread word of Mileena's demise. Elihu was delighted at sailing and seeing new places, he expressed a desire to travel until he found more half-orcs or more blacksmiths. 
</p>

<p>
Pisces 7th, 159
</p>

<p>
Sailed east. 
</p>

<p>
Pisces 8th, 159
</p>

<p>
Turning south to follow the coast, the Heirs saw other ships sailing west to east to a large port city. They followed suit, docking at a pier in the city of Truro. The ship was greated by a squad of guards, commanded by a woman named Cecily. She collected a docking fee of ten Yisans, gold coins with Yisan's face on them. She asked of news from the Eastern front, where barbarians from the East had invaded Yisan's kingdom five years ago. The Heirs claimed to be from further West. Cecily advised them that it was customary to tip bards. 
</p>

<p>
An arrangement was struck with Captain Bartleby, wherein he would make his ship ready to sail at noon each day, and otherwise he and his men would explore and enjoy Truro. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs headed to the dock entrance, where they saw a giant statue of Yisan, a rogueish tiefling playing a lute. Arrayed around it were scores of bards. Some of them approached the Heirs, playing songs and collecting tips. Lanaster counter-played at them, annoying an Elven bard, who objected at the unathorized song and threatened to find a supervisor. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs continued into Truro, which was densely populated, grimy, and bustling. Concerned about their low supply of Yisan coins, Kogrash proposed finding a moneychanger. Bridgette, Damemon, and Elihu accompanied him. A bard offered to take them to an honest moneychanger, in a building close to the docks. The man was located, and negotiations ensued. Kogrash claimed to have found a dead Easterner - the only good Easterner, the moneychanger gibed - and taken platinum coins from his body. A deal was struck - some silver and gold Yisans and a bag of magical berries for a great deal of platinum. 
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Kyruss visited the harbormaster, and was shown maps of the area. Curiously, there was a large swath of land that was blank, which went unremarked upon by the harbor master. Kyruss asked where Yisan lived, and was told that he lived on the front, always battling the Easterners to protect the kingdom. 
</p>

<p>
At the same time, Lanaster disguised himself, then observed the bards. He learned that there was an approved repertoire of forty songs which were allowed to be played. Among them were:
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Many songs about the barbaric and cruel Easterners, and their atrocities
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Many songs about Yisan being chosen by fate to save the kingdom.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
The Planning Fisherman - a clever fisherman studied fish to increase his catch, but was unable to do any better, because he wasn't fated to do so.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
The Fieldhand Who Saw Something - a brave fieldhand saw tracks in the fields and suspected they were from a force of Easterners. He followed the tracks, and inadvertently foiled an ambush set up by Yisan's forces. He should have alerted the authorities. 
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
There's No Such Thing As the Dying Lands - stories about dying lands are made up by our enemies to break our will. 
</div>
</p>

<p>
Elihu thanked the Heirs for everything they'd done, and went off on his own. 
</p>

<p>
The magical berries turned out to be fake. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs booked rooms in a modest inn. Lanaster outplayed a local bard named Justine. 
</p>

<p>
Pisces 9th, 159
</p>

<p>
The Heirs awoke and got ready, planning to travel deeper into Yisan's domain. Passing through the streets, they saw Elihu dancing on a street corner for coppers. His dancing was oddly mechanical and jerky. They approached and tried to remove him, but a thick-necked ruffian named Giles told them to keep their hands off the talent. Elihu explained that had happened to him - he sought a loan to start a blacksmith's shop, and was referred to a Mr. Glitters. Mr. Glitters showed Elihu a box of gold coins, and a contract was made - Elihu got the box and its contents, and had to make regular payments, the first due in only fifteen minutes. Upon default, Mr. Glitters would own Elihu's body for a year. Elihu tried to make the first payment, only to discover that the gold coins were in reality leaves, made to look like coins via magic. As the contract was for "the box and its contents", Elihu had been fooled and fell into Mr. Glitters' control. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs used <i>dispel magic </i>to free Elihu, and demanded to see Mr. Glitters, and Giles took them to a tavern on the coast. In a back room was Mr. Glitters, a tiny man in a fine suit with a hat made of leaves, along with a goat-like man and a satyr-like man. The Heirs objected to the scam pulled on Elihu, but Mr. Glitters told them he had connections in Yisan's court and was untouchable. The Heirs beat Mr. Glitters into unconsciousness, bribed his guards with the copious gold on Mr. Glitters' person, and burned down the tavern. Mr. Glitters was placed in a bag and carried away. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs headed for the docks, where a group of guards were showing sketches of Kogrash, Damemon, and Bridgette, who were suspected of being Eastern infiltrators. They were spotted, and a chase broke out. Bridgette ran for a while, failing to hide, while Kyruss and Lanaster followed along in the mob. Bridgette was soon surrounded. Lanaster cast <i>hypnotic pattern </i>and then <i>enthrall</i>, allowing Bridgette to slip away. 
</p>

<p>
Kogrash and Damemon, with Elihu, made a run for it. They tired, and made a stand at a narrow corner between houses. The pursuers were led by Ceclily, who revealed that they were wanted for possessing Eastern coins. Kogrash repeated his story about finding them, but it was unconvincing. He battled the guards, killing Cecily and another. Damemon circled around, and convinced the remaining guards that he was an agent of Yisan, before ordering them to fall back. 
</p>

<p>
The Heirs reuinited south of town. Elihu expressed a desire to return to Torbay, and Kogrash gave him some money to do so.
